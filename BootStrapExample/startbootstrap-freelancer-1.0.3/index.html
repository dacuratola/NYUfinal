                            <p>There are so many reasons we need to be certain out computer files are backed up and secure.  Unfortunately there are just as many reasons we neglect to do it.</p>
                            <p>The reasons to backup are obvious.  Our laptop may crash.  It may be compromised by virus, or malware.  Perhaps we are careless and physically lose it.  Any of these things can put us into a situation where we need to get our files back from the abyss
                            </p>
                            <p>The reasons we neglect backing up are also obvious.  We think it's difficult.  We think it takes too much time.  You may never have done it before and perhaps you don't exactly know how.  Any of these excuses can put you and your files at risk.</p>
                            <p>In any case, I can help.  I can set up effective backup for your computer or entire network.  I can have that backup happen at your home/office alternatively I can cconfigure it to happen in 'the cloud'.  Don't worry if you are uncertain what 'the cloud' exactly means.  I certainly do.</p>
                            <p>With regard to cloud store; I have clients who use, Google Drive, DropBox, Moxy, iCloud, Microsoft One Drive, Box and others.  By helping and advising them I provide a sense of security along with peace of mind.</p>

                            <p>I support many small business operations.  The class of business is typically what I refer to as 'owner-operated' small business.  The type of operations are quite varied.  I am constantly amazed at the variety of activities my clients do from a relatively small offices and staffs.  I have clients who are attorney, realtors, editors, real estate investors, property managers, jewelry designers/importers, hedge fund operators and private investors.  I consider this group among the brightest and most successful in the world.</p>

                            <p>I offer these small businesses the convenience of having an IT person on call without the expense of a fulltime, or parttime, employee.  In fact several of the business owners refer to me as the CIO of the firm.</p>

                            <p>I consult on hardware purchases as well as software and operating sytem upgrades.  I install and test each change to the work environment.  Changes are considered successful when there is no impact to an employee work flow.</p>

                            <p>Increasingly I advise on the availability of open source software.  Most of my clients are not aware what open source is. They approach the subject with apprehension and reservations.  While it's my job to be conservative in IT expenditures, I balance that with maintaining workflow.  As a small business owner/operator myself this is the hat I wear too.  I am no stranger to keep expenses low.  Open source software provides a solution to many business needs for my clients.</p>

                            <p>I am responsible for software installations of various accounting packages (Intuit and ProSeries), billing packages (Time Slips) and custom database applications.  I do version control amd track changes along for the client.</p>

We need to stay connected.</p>

Virus, to me, means anything I do not want.  It can be maleware (malicious) or bloatware (came with something else).  Many times a virus will ask you to purchase the remedy online.</p> 
                            <p>The first thing on my agenda is to ensure my clients do not get a computer virus to begin with.</p>
                            <p>However, give that PC viruses are a reality in 2015, a common thing for me to do is remove virus from Windows computers that have been infected.  The objective is to get the PC running fine again, quickly and with the least impact to the user.</p>
                            <p>I will analyze your infected PC.  I will recommend and perform whatever is needed to get it working well again. My experience with Windows PC virus is extensive.</p>

It puts you at a tremendous disadvantage.</p>

Second determinant, able to be used on any platform, desktop, laptop, table, phone, x-box, overhead projector.  Scaling should not make your website look bad.  Of course, it should provide accuate and complete information and provide a method for the reader to contact you, and a two way conversation to begin.

                            <p>Increasingly web traffic is being delivered to phones and tablets.  It is reported that more media is being delivered to phones and tablets then is being delivered to desktops. The implication is clear - if you're not able to reach your audience through mobile search or display, or you're not providing a satisfactory mobile experience you will miss out compared to competitors who are.</p>

                            <p>According to CNN/Money mobile apps for the first time surpassed desktop browsers in internet usage.  This occured in January of 2015 and the trend continues to escalate.  Sales of smart phones and tablets outpace laptops and desktops.</p>

                            <p>Apps are a relatively new area of internet traffic emerging in popularity with the widespread proliferation of smartphones.  I have have development experience and have published an app to the App Store for Apple IOS devices.  My app delivers sports updates from a noted blogger via RSS push notifications.</p>

                            <p>If you have a need, I can create an IOS app for you.</p>

                            <p>If this is something you would like me to have done simply notify me by using the contact form and we can start talking.</p>

                            <p>When I started Byte Sized Computing, the mission was to provide computing education and training.  Increasingly I found myself being asked to help someone with their home computer.  Setting up printers, scanners and configuring internet access in someones home became a big part of my work.  To this day I still love doing it.</p>
                            <p>Of course, alot has changed since the days of installing AOL using floppy disks.  High speed internet, wireless coverage and enormous advances in technology have changed the way our home PCs work.  I have changed my service offerings along with the times.</p>
                            <p>Macs have overtaken PC's with my clients.  iPhones have replaced most every other phone, including residential home lines.  Windows10 has replaced DOS and Windows 3.1 Cloud storage has made spacious hard drives redundant in many cases.  But one thing remains the same, I stand ready to support my residential clients with any IT need they may have.</p>
                            <p>If you, or someone you know would like me to help with some IT issue at your house, or perhaps you need someone to help with question & answer on using a popular Mac or Windows product, please let me know by using the contact form on this page.</p>
